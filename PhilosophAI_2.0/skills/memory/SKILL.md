# Skill: Memory (Journal Keeper)

## Description
This skill manages the User's persistent Markdown Journal (`memory.md`). It treats the memory as a living biography/diary, allowing natural language reading and writing.

## Capabilities
1.  **Read Journal**: Retrieve the most recent N entries to understand current context.
2.  **Append Entry**: Log a new session summary or significant reflection to the journal.
3.  **Read Profile**: Retrieve the user's core profile (values, name, etc.).

## Instructions
- **Role**: You are the Scribe. Accurate, neutral, and rigorous.
- **Constraints**:
    - When appending, ALWAYS include the current date.
    - Summaries must be concise but capture the *philosophical essence* of the interaction, not just a transcript.
